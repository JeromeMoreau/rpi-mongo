# rpi-mongo
Docker Mongo DB 2.6 Image for the Raspberry Pi 1/2.

This Mongo DB is based on the cross compiled version of Mongo which
was originally described here:
http://andyfelong.com/2015/02/mongodb-on-the-raspberry-pi-2/

Please have a look at my rpi-nightscout repo to get a description how this
container can be used.

The ready-to-go docker image can be accessed from my docker hub repository:
